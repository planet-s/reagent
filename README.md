Redox OS Standard Tests

[Reagent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent) - A reagent is a substance or
compound added to a system to cause a chemical reaction, or added to test if a
reaction occurs.

This repository provides templates for easily setting up a Rust repository with
all of the required files for GitLab and GitHub CI with Debian packaging, cargo
formatting, cargo tests, and various other features.

It is still work-in-progress, and is tuned to meet the requirements of both
Redox OS and Pop OS. Templates can be overridden on a one-by-one basis, without
a need to recompile. For more extensive modifications, it may either be forked
or used as a library.
